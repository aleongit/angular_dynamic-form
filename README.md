## Building dynamic forms

- https://angular.io/guide/dynamic-form

- Many forms, such as questionnaires, can be very similar to one another in format and intent. To make it faster and easier to generate different versions of such a form, you can create a *dynamic form template* based on metadata that describes the business object model. Then, use the template to generate new forms automatically, according to changes in the data model.

- The technique is particularly useful when you have a type of form whose content must change frequently to meet rapidly changing business and regulatory requirements. A typical use-case is a questionnaire. You might need to get input from users in different contexts. The format and style of the forms a user sees should remain constant, while the actual questions you need to ask vary with the context.

- In this tutorial you will build a dynamic form that presents a basic questionnaire. You build an online application for heroes seeking employment. The agency is constantly tinkering with the application process, but by using the dynamic form you can create the new forms on the fly without changing the application code.

- The tutorial walks you through the following steps.

    - Enable reactive forms for a project.
    - Establish a data model to represent form controls.
    - Populate the model with sample data.
    - Develop a component to create form controls dynamically.

- The form you create uses input validation and styling to improve the user experience. It has a Submit button that is only enabled when all user input is valid, and flags invalid input with color coding and error messages.

- The basic version can evolve to support a richer variety of questions, more graceful rendering, and superior user experience.
